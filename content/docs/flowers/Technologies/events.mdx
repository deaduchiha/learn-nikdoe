# 🖱 React Events — Synthetic Event System

In plain HTML/JS, you might attach multiple native event listeners:

````js
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);


But in **React**, you write:

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
````

So what's the difference?

React uses a **Synthetic Event System** — a smart layer that wraps around native browser events.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- What synthetic events are
- Why React uses them
- How React improves performance with one listener
- How to use events in components
- Differences from native events

---

## 🔹 What Is a Synthetic Event?

A **synthetic event** is a **wrapper around a native event** that works the same way **across all browsers**.

React doesn't attach hundreds of listeners — instead, it uses **one global listener** at the root (like `document`) and delegates events internally.

✅ Benefits:

- Unified, cross-browser behavior
- Memory efficient — fewer listeners
- Built-in event pooling (until React 17)
- Performance optimized for large apps

---

## 🧪 Example: Using Synthetic Events

```jsx
function App() {
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    console.log("Clicked!", event.type); // Synthetic event
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

🧠 `event` is a **SyntheticEvent**, not a raw browser event.

---

## 🔸 How React Listens to Events

Instead of doing this:

```html
<button onclick="..."></button>
<!-- one listener per button -->
```

React does this under the hood:

```
document.addEventListener("click", ...) // only once!
```

Then it figures out which component actually triggered the event. This is called **event delegation**.

---

## 🔸 Supported Events

React supports most common events:

- **Mouse**: `onClick`, `onDoubleClick`, `onMouseEnter`
- **Keyboard**: `onKeyDown`, `onKeyPress`, `onKeyUp`
- **Form**: `onChange`, `onSubmit`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`
- **Touch**: `onTouchStart`, `onTouchEnd`, `onTouchMove`

✅ These work the same across browsers — thanks to the synthetic event layer.

---

## 🔹 Event Object Properties

```jsx
function Input() {
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    console.log(e.target.value); // just like normal JS
  };

  return <input onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

Synthetic events mimic native ones, so you still get access to:

- `e.target`
- `e.preventDefault()`
- `e.stopPropagation()`
- `e.type`, `e.currentTarget`, etc.

---

## ⚠️ Note on React 17+

In React 17+, events **bubble to the root of the container**, not the `document`.

This gives you:

- Better control with multiple React apps on one page
- More native-like behavior
- Still one listener, but scoped more tightly

---

## 🧪 Homework Tasks

1. ✅ Create a `Button` component and log the event object inside `onClick`.
2. ✅ Try using `e.preventDefault()` on a link to stop it from navigating.
3. ✅ Create an `Input` that logs `e.target.value` on every keystroke.

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept              | Explanation                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Synthetic Event      | React's cross-browser wrapper for native events |
| One Global Listener  | React uses delegation, not per-element handlers |
| Unified API          | Works the same across Chrome, Firefox, Safari   |
| Supports Most Events | Keyboard, Mouse, Touch, Forms, Clipboard, etc.  |
