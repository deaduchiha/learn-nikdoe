# 🧩 React DOM — The Runtime

When you write React code like `<App />`, it doesn’t automatically appear in the browser.  
React needs a **runtime engine** to connect your components to the **real DOM**.  
That engine is called **React DOM**.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- What React DOM is and what it does
- The role of `ReactDOM.createRoot()` and `root.render()`
- How your JSX code gets rendered in the browser
- Real DOM vs Virtual DOM

## 🔹 What Is React DOM?

**React DOM** is the **runtime library** that lets React interact with the **actual browser DOM**.

Without React DOM, your JSX would never make it to the screen.

---

### 💻 A Simple Example

````jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);


Here’s what each line does:

| Code                       | What It Does                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ReactDOM.createRoot(...)` | Creates a React "root" in the real DOM         |
| `root.render(<App />)`     | Renders your React app inside that DOM element |
| `<App />`                  | Your top-level component                       |

---

## 🔸 Real DOM vs Virtual DOM

React builds a **Virtual DOM** first — a lightweight JS object that mimics the UI.

Then, using **React DOM**, it compares the virtual version to the actual DOM and makes the minimal changes required.

```txt
JSX → Virtual DOM → (diff) → Real DOM
````

✅ **Fast and efficient DOM updates**

## 🔹 Visual Diagram: How Rendering Works

```
┌────────────┐
│   <App />  │ ← You write this
└────┬───────┘
     ▼
┌────────────┐
│ Virtual DOM│ ← React builds a JS object tree
└────┬───────┘
     ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ React DOM   │ ← Compares & updates browser DOM
└────┬────────┘
     ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Real Browser │ ← UI appears on screen
└──────────────┘
```

## 🔸 React DOM API (React 18+)

React 18 introduced **concurrent rendering** and replaced `ReactDOM.render()` with `ReactDOM.createRoot()`.

```js
// Old (React 17)
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// New (React 18+)
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

> ✅ Always use `createRoot` for full React 18+ features like **suspense**, **transitions**, and **streaming**.

---

## 🧪 Homework Tasks

1. ✅ Create a basic React app and identify where `ReactDOM.createRoot()` is used.
2. ✅ Modify your JSX and see how React updates the DOM efficiently.
3. ✅ Open Chrome DevTools and inspect the `#root` element to see where your app lives.

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept          | Meaning                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| React DOM        | Runtime that connects React to the browser      |
| `createRoot`     | Initializes the React rendering engine          |
| `render(<App/>)` | Starts the rendering of your component tree     |
| Virtual DOM      | JS representation of UI before it hits real DOM |
