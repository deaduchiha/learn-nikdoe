## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- What a bundler does (and why it’s important)
- How Vite, esbuild, and Webpack work
- What bundling means in a modern React project
- How bundlers help with performance and scalability

## 🔹 What Is a Bundler?

A **bundler** takes your app's many files (JS, CSS, images, etc.) and **combines them into a few optimized output files**.

````txt
input/
├─ App.jsx
├─ styles.css
├─ logo.png
└─ utils/
   └─ helpers.js

▼

output/
├─ bundle.js
├─ style.css


✅ Benefits:

* Fewer HTTP requests
* Minified and compressed files
* Faster load time
* Supports modern tools like JSX and modules

## 🔧 Popular Bundlers at a Glance

| Tool        | Engine         | Key Features                           |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Vite**    | uses `esbuild` | Lightning-fast dev server, hot reload  |
| **esbuild** | written in Go  | Ultra-fast JS/TS bundler, zero config  |
| **Webpack** | plugin-based   | Powerful and flexible, used by Next.js |

---

## ⚡ Vite (Default for Modern React)

Vite is a new-generation bundler that uses **esbuild** under the hood for development.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
````

### 🔥 Features:

- Instant startup (no bundling on dev)
- HMR (Hot Module Reloading)
- Native ESM support
- Works great with React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

---

## 🛠 esbuild (The Speed King)

esbuild is an extremely fast JS bundler and minifier.

```bash
npx esbuild app.jsx --bundle --outfile=bundle.js
```

✅ It's often used **behind the scenes** in tools like:

- Vite (for dev)
- Bun
- Snowpack

---

## 🏗 Webpack (The Old Giant)

Webpack is the traditional bundler used in **Create React App** and **Next.js**.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

### Key Features:

- Highly customizable with loaders and plugins
- Handles images, CSS, SVG, and more
- Powerful production optimizations

> 🧠 More flexible, but also more complex to configure manually.

## 🧪 Homework Tasks

1. ✅ Create a new React app using **Vite** and explore the `vite.config.js`.
2. ✅ Use `esbuild` from CLI to bundle a simple JS file.
3. ✅ Compare the output bundle sizes between CRA and Vite.

| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Bundler | Combines files into 1+ optimized files |
| Vite    | Fastest dev experience using esbuild   |
| esbuild | Core tech behind many new bundlers     |
| Webpack | Very flexible, powerful, but heavier   |
