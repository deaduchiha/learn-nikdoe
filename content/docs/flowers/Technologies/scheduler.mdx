# ⏳ Scheduler — React Fiber Engine

When you update state in React, a lot of work might happen: recalculating components, rerendering UI, managing side effects…

So how does React stay fast and smooth even with thousands of components?

🎯 **Answer:** React uses a clever scheduling system called **Fiber**.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- What React Fiber is and what problem it solves
- How scheduling keeps apps fast
- What "interruptible rendering" means
- The idea of priority-based updates
- Examples of how React slices work

---

## 🔹 What Is Fiber?

**Fiber** is the internal rendering engine introduced in **React 16**.  
Its main goal is to make rendering **interruptible** and **non-blocking**.

> 🧠 Before Fiber, React updates were synchronous — once started, they couldn't be paused.

Now, Fiber lets React:

- **Pause** and **resume** work
- **Cancel** work that’s no longer needed
- **Prioritize** urgent tasks (like clicks) over slow ones (like animations)

---

## 🔄 Why Is Scheduling Important?

Imagine this:

````js
// A slow component
useEffect(() => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1_000_000_000; i++) {}
}, []);


Without scheduling, the browser **freezes**.

With Fiber, React breaks that work into **chunks**, rendering part by part when the browser is idle — keeping the page **snappy** and **interactive**.

## ⚙️ How Fiber Schedules Work

```pgsql
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ User clicks a button │
└───────┬────────────────────┘
▼
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ React starts rendering │
│ - Checks if work is urgent │
│ - Breaks big updates into │
│ tiny "units of work" │
└───────┬────────────────────┘
▼
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ Browser stays interactive │
│ React works in background │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

````

✅ This is called **concurrent rendering** — React does only what’s needed **right now**, and defers the rest.

---

## 🔸 High vs Low Priority Updates

React automatically assigns **priority levels** to updates:

| Example             | Priority |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Typing into input   | High     |
| Clicking a button   | High     |
| Loading long list   | Low      |
| Animating something | Low      |

React **schedules high-priority updates first**, and fits low-priority work when the browser is free.

---

## 🔸 When Does Fiber Run?

Fiber is used every time React does:

- `setState()`
- `useState()` or `useReducer()` updates
- Component mounting or updating
- Lazy component loading

React **rebuilds a Fiber tree** and renders it **piece-by-piece**.

---

## 🧪 Homework Tasks

1. ✅ Create a heavy component with a long loop in `useEffect()` — see the blocking behavior.
2. ✅ Add a `setTimeout` or `useTransition` to delay work and observe smoother behavior.
3. ✅ Explore `React DevTools Profiler` to see rendering times and Fiber scheduling.

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept       | Meaning                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Fiber Engine  | React’s internal scheduler since React 16           |
| Interruptible | Can pause, split, cancel rendering                  |
| Concurrent    | React can prioritize quick updates over heavy tasks |
| Keeps UI fast | No blocking or freezing even with big components    |
