## 1 · What is React?

React is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces.
It helps you build fast, interactive user interfaces (UIs) for websites and web apps.
Think of React as Lego bricks for the web: you click pieces together to build big things.

- **Library**, not a full framework — you keep the freedom to choose routers, data tools, and styling libraries. [Learn more about libraries vs frameworks →](/docs/flowers/library-vs-framework)
- Created by **Facebook (now Meta)** in 2013 to solve UI complexity at scale.

> **Why people love it:** Re‑usable components, fast updates, strong community, and works on web _and_ mobile (React Native).

## 2 · Technologies React Uses

| Layer      | Tech                            | What it does                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Language   | **JavaScript (ES6 +)**          | Modern syntax like `import`, `class`, arrow functions     |
| Syntax     | **JSX**                         | Lets you write HTML‑looking code inside JS                |
| Transpiler | **Babel**                       | Turns JSX & modern JS into code every browser understands |
| Bundler    | **Vite / esbuild** (or Webpack) | Glues every file into one optimized bundle                |
| Runtime    | **React DOM**                   | Connects React to the browser’s real DOM                  |
| Scheduler  | **Fiber**                       | Slices big work so the page stays snappy                  |
| Events     | **Synthetic Event System**      | One smart listener instead of many native ones            |

## 3 · How React Works Behind the Scenes

1. **Write JSX**

   ```jsx
   <h1>Hello React!</h1>
   ```

2. **Babel transforms** it into plain JavaScript:

   ```js
   React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello React!");
   ```

3. React builds a **Virtual DOM** — a lightweight JS object describing the UI tree.
4. On first render, React **mounts** real DOM nodes matching that tree.
5. When state changes, React builds a _new_ Virtual DOM, **diffs** it with the previous tree (this step is _reconciliation_), and figures out the smallest set of changes **(patch)** needed.
6. The **Fiber scheduler** spreads that patch work over short time slices so scrolling and animation stay smooth.
7. Finally, React applies those changes with regular DOM APIs.

> **Big idea:** React is fast because it does _less_ real DOM work and schedules it smartly.

## 4 · Mini‑React in 40 Lines

Below is a _tiny_ toy version of React to show the core idea (not production‑ready!):

```js
// 1. create "element"
function h(type, props, ...children) {
  return { type, props: props || {}, children };
}

/**
 * Turn a “virtual node” into real DOM and put it inside a parent element.
 * @param {Object|string} node   Virtual node object OR plain text.
 * @param {HTMLElement}   parent Real DOM element that will receive the new content.
 */
function render(node, parent) {
  // 1️⃣ If the node is just text, make a text node and add it, then stop.
  if (typeof node === "string") {
    parent.appendChild(document.createTextNode(node));
    return;
  }

  // 2️⃣ Create a real DOM element such as <div>, <button>, etc.
  const el = document.createElement(node.type);

  // 3️⃣ Copy each property (className, onclick, etc.) onto the new element.
  Object.entries(node.props).forEach(([k, v]) => (el[k] = v));

  // 4️⃣ Go through every child, flatten nested arrays, and render them too.
  node.children.flat().forEach((child) => render(child, el));

  // 5️⃣ After all children are ready, add this element to its parent.
  parent.appendChild(el);
}

// Usage
const tree = h(
  "ul",
  { className: "list" },
  h("li", null, "🍎 Apple"),
  h("li", null, "🍊 Orange")
);

render(tree, document.getElementById("root"));
```

This mini version:

- Builds a JS object tree (our **virtual DOM**).
- Walks the tree and creates real DOM nodes.
- Does a full re‑render every time (no diffing yet).

> Seeing the simple version demystifies React. Underneath, it is plain JavaScript manipulating the DOM cleverly.

## 5 · Homework 🏡

1. **Play with the Virtual DOM**

   - Copy the _Mini‑React_ code into a blank HTML file.
   - Add a button that re‑renders the list with one extra fruit. Notice the flicker (full re‑render). Imagine how diffing would improve it.

2. **Explain React to a friend**
   - In five sentences, tell someone _why_ React exists and _what problem_ it solves.
