## Introduction

In modern JavaScript development, **packages** are reusable pieces of code—libraries or tools—that you can install and use in your projects. A **package manager** helps you find, install, update, and remove these packages. Two popular JavaScript package managers today are **npm** (Node Package Manager) and **Bun**. This document explains:

1. What packages and package managers are
2. How to use **npm**
3. How to use **Bun**
4. Key differences between npm and Bun
5. Best practices
6. Homework exercises

Each section uses simple English, clear examples, and at the end of the document there are exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Section 1: What Are Packages and Package Managers?

### 1.1 Packages

- A **package** (sometimes called a "module") is a folder of code that can include:

  - JavaScript files
  - Metadata (like name, version, author)
  - Dependencies (other packages it needs to work)

- Example packages:

  - **Lodash** (`lodash`) for utility functions (e.g., `_.map`, `_.cloneDeep`)
  - **Express** (`express`) for web servers
  - **React** (`react`) for building user interfaces

When you install a package, you can use its exported functions or objects in your code via `import` (ESM) or `require` (CommonJS).

### 1.2 Package Managers

A **package manager** is a tool that:

1. **Installs** packages from a central registry (like the npm registry)
2. **Manages** versions and dependencies of packages
3. **Updates** packages when new versions are available
4. **Uninstalls** packages you no longer need

Without a package manager, you would have to manually download, copy, and link code—very error prone. With a package manager, you simply run a command like `npm install lodash` and it handles everything.

---

## Section 2: npm (Node Package Manager)

npm is the oldest and most widely used JavaScript package manager. It comes bundled with Node.js and uses the **npm registry** to download packages.

### 2.1 Initializing a Project (`package.json`)

Every npm-based project has a `package.json` file at its root. This file holds metadata and lists dependencies. To create one:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
npm init
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- **name** (e.g., `my-project`)
- **version** (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- **description** (e.g., `A demo project using npm`)
- **entry point** (e.g., `index.js`)
- **author** and **license**

If you want to skip the prompts and accept defaults, run `npm init -y`. A minimal `package.json` might look like:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A demo project using npm",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"No tests yet\""
  },
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {}
}
```

- **`scripts`**: Custom commands you can run via `npm run <script-name>`.
- **`dependencies`**: Packages your project needs at runtime.
- **`devDependencies`**: Packages needed only during development (e.g., testing tools, linters).

### 2.2 Installing Packages

To install a package and save it to **dependencies**:

```bash
npm install lodash
```

This does three things:

1. Downloads `lodash` (latest version) into `node_modules/`
2. Adds `"lodash": "^<version>"` under `"dependencies"` in `package.json`
3. Creates or updates `package-lock.json` to lock exact versions

To install a package as a **development dependency**:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint
```

This adds `"eslint": "^<version>"` under `"devDependencies"`. Development dependencies will not be bundled when you deploy production code (for example, Docker builds will typically omit devDependencies).

#### 2.2.1 Common npm Commands

- **`npm install`** (or `npm i`): Installs all packages listed in `package.json` (reads `dependencies` and `devDependencies`).
- **`npm install <package-name>@<version>`**: Installs a specific version, e.g. `npm install express@4.18.2`.
- **`npm update`**: Updates packages to the latest version that satisfies the semver range in `package.json`.
- **`npm uninstall <package-name>`**: Removes a package from `node_modules` and from `package.json`.
- **`npm outdated`**: Lists packages that have newer versions than what your `package.json` allows.
- **`npm audit`**: Checks for known security vulnerabilities in installed dependencies.

### 2.3 Semantic Versioning (semver)

npm uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver) to manage package versions. A version has three parts: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example `2.5.1`.

- **PATCH** (`x.y.1` → `x.y.2`): Bug fixes, no new features.
- **MINOR** (`x.1.0` → `x.2.0`): Backward-compatible new features.
- **MAJOR** (`1.0.0` → `2.0.0`): Breaking changes or incompatible API updates.

In `package.json`, version ranges often include a caret (`^`) or tilde (`~`):

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.21", // install the latest 4.x.x version (>=4.17.21 <5.0.0)
    "lodash": "~4.17.21" // install the latest 4.17.x version (>=4.17.21 <4.18.0)
  }
}
```

Using caret (`^`) is common because it allows non-breaking updates automatically when you run `npm update`.

### 2.4 Global vs Local Installs

- **Local install** (default): Places packages under `./node_modules/` and records them in your project's `package.json`. Use this for libraries your code depends on.

  ```bash
  npm install express
  ```

- **Global install**: Installs a package to a central location on your machine, making its CLI tools available anywhere. Use `-g` or `--global`:

  ```bash
  npm install -g http-server
  ```

  Now you can run `http-server` from any terminal. Do **not** install libraries (React, Lodash, etc.) globally—only CLI tools (e.g., `eslint`, `nodemon`, `npm` itself).

### 2.5 `package-lock.json`

- When you install or update packages, npm creates or updates a `package-lock.json`.
- This file **locks exact dependency versions**, including nested dependencies, so that every install on any machine yields identical code.
- **Do not edit** `package-lock.json` manually. Commit it to version control to ensure consistency for your entire team.

## Section 3: Bun (A New JavaScript Runtime & Package Manager)

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a newer JavaScript runtime (like Node.js) that includes its own built-in package manager, bundler, and task runner. It aims to be faster and more efficient than Node.js + npm/Yarn.

> **Note**: Bun is still evolving. Some packages or tools may not yet work 100% with Bun. Always check compatibility before adopting Bun for production.

### 3.1 Installing Bun

1. On macOS or Linux, run:

   ```bash
   curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

2. On Windows, follow instructions at [https://bun.sh/](https://bun.sh/) (using WSL or a native build).
3. After installation, restart your terminal and confirm:

   ```bash
   bun --version
   ```

### 3.2 Bun Project Initialization (`bun init`)

Like `npm init`, Bun can create a `package.json` (and other project files) with one command:

```bash
bun init
```

You will be prompted for:

- **Project name**
- **Version**
- **Entry file** (e.g., `index.js`)
- **Description**, **author**, **license**

After running `bun init`, you'll see:

- A `package.json` similar to npm's
- A lockfile called `bun.lockb` (binary format, specific to Bun)

Example `package.json` created by Bun:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "my-bun-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "bun run index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

### 3.3 Installing Packages with Bun

To install a package, use:

```bash
bun add lodash
```

This does:

1. Fetches package metadata from the npm registry by default.
2. Installs `lodash` into `node_modules/`.
3. Updates `package.json` under `"dependencies"`.
4. Updates or creates `bun.lockb` to lock dependencies.

If you want to add a **development dependency**:

```bash
bun add --dev eslint
```

Key Bun equivalents for npm commands:

| Purpose                  | npm Command            | Bun Command               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Install all dependencies | `npm install`          | `bun install`             |
| Add a dependency         | `npm install <pkg>`    | `bun add <pkg>`           |
| Add a dev dependency     | `npm install -D <pkg>` | `bun add --dev <pkg>`     |
| Remove a dependency      | `npm uninstall <pkg>`  | `bun remove <pkg>`        |
| Update dependencies      | `npm update`           | `bun update`              |
| List outdated packages   | `npm outdated`         | (Not yet fully supported) |

#### 3.3.1 Speed Comparison

- **Bun** uses a faster resolver and native code for many tasks, often installing packages several times faster than npm.
- **npm** is stable, mature, and supported by most CI/CD systems, but can be slower on large dependency trees.

### 3.4 Running Scripts with Bun

In `package.json`, scripts work similarly:

```jsonc
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

To run an npm-style script, use:

```bash
bun run start
bun run test
```

Bun also offers `bun x` to run binaries from your local `node_modules/.bin`:

```bash
bun x eslint .
```

(This runs the locally installed `eslint` without needing `npx`.)

### 3.5 Bun's Lockfile: `bun.lockb`

- Bun uses a binary lockfile (`bun.lockb`) instead of JSON (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`).
- **Do not edit** `bun.lockb` manually.
- Commit `bun.lockb` to version control to ensure every developer uses the same locked versions.

### 3.6 Using Bun vs Node.js Directly

- **`bun run <script>`** automatically uses Bun's runtime (which is very fast).
- You can still run `node index.js` if you want to use Node.js instead of Bun's JS engine (e.g., to test compatibility).

## Section 4: Comparing npm and Bun

| Feature                         | npm                                                     | Bun                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Age & Maturity**              | Released 2010, very stable & widely used                | Released 2022, rapidly evolving but newer                                                  |
| **Speed**                       | Generally slower on large installs                      | Very fast – especially for installs and script execution                                   |
| **Lockfile Format**             | `package-lock.json` (JSON)                              | `bun.lockb` (binary)                                                                       |
| **Registry**                    | npm registry by default                                 | npm registry by default (can add alternate registries)                                     |
| **CLI Syntax**                  | `npm install`, `npm run`, `npm uninstall`, etc.         | `bun add`, `bun remove`, `bun run`, `bun install`                                          |
| **Compatibility**               | Works with all Node.js packages and tools               | Aims to be compatible with most npm packages, but some native addons or scripts might fail |
| **Global Installs**             | `npm install -g <pkg>`                                  | `bun install -g <pkg>`                                                                     |
| **Scripts Execution**           | Uses Node.js by default                                 | Uses Bun's JS runtime by default                                                           |
| **Ecosystem & Community Tools** | Huge ecosystem, many tutorials, many CI/CD integrations | Growing ecosystem; integrate Bun as drop-in replacement, but check build pipelines         |

### 4.1 Choosing Between npm and Bun

- Use **npm** if:

  - You need maximum stability and compatibility.
  - Your CI/CD pipeline already expects `npm` or `yarn`.
  - You use older or obscure packages that may not work well with Bun.

- Use **Bun** if:

  - You want faster installs and builds.
  - You are starting a new project and want to experiment.
  - You are comfortable troubleshooting occasional compatibility issues.

You can even mix: use Bun locally for speed, but keep `npm` scripts in CI until you confirm Bun works there.

---

## Section 5: Best Practices

### 5.1 Always Commit Your Lockfile

- For **npm**: commit `package-lock.json`.
- For **Bun**: commit `bun.lockb`.
- This ensures everyone on your team (or in your CI environment) installs identical versions of dependencies.

### 5.2 Separate Dependencies vs DevDependencies

- **Dependencies**: needed when your code runs in production (e.g., `express`, `react`).
- **DevDependencies**: needed during development only (e.g., `eslint`, `jest`, `webpack`).

Example:

```bash
npm install express        # => added to "dependencies"
npm install --save-dev jest # => added to "devDependencies"
```

or with Bun:

```bash
bun add express
bun add --dev jest
```

### 5.3 Semantic Versioning & Version Ranges

- Use caret (`^`) by default so that minor/patch updates apply when you run `npm update` or `bun update`.
- Avoid using asterisks (`*`) or overly broad ranges, which can cause unexpected breaking changes.

Example in `package.json`:

```jsonc
"dependencies": {
  "lodash": "^4.17.21",
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```

### 5.4 Lockfile Hygiene

- After adding or removing dependencies, run:

  - **npm**: `npm install` to update `package-lock.json`.
  - **Bun**: `bun install` to update `bun.lockb`.

- Don't manually edit lockfiles.

### 5.5 Script Naming & Usage

- Use clear script names. For example:

  ```jsonc
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "build": "webpack --config webpack.config.js",
    "test": "jest"
  }
  ```

- Run scripts consistently:

  - **npm**: `npm run dev`
  - **Bun**: `bun run dev` or `bun x jest` (if you want to run a binary directly)

### 5.6 When to Upgrade or Migrate

- If you have a stable project using **npm**, you can experiment with Bun in a separate branch or fork.
- Run your test suite under Bun:

  ```bash
  bun run test
  ```

- Ensure your build (production bundle) works as expected under Bun before fully switching. Some native modules or Node-specific APIs may need polyfills or adjustments.

## Section 6: Homework Exercises

1. **Initialize a project using npm and add dependencies**

   - Create a new folder `npm-demo`.
   - Run `npm init -y` to generate `package.json`.
   - Install `express` as a dependency and `nodemon` as a devDependency.
   - Verify that `package.json` contains correct entries under `"dependencies"` and `"devDependencies"`.
   - Run `npm install` to generate `package-lock.json`.

2. **Initialize a project using Bun and compare**

   - In a separate folder `bun-demo`, run `bun init`.
   - Install `express` and `nodemon` with `bun add express` and `bun add --dev nodemon`.
   - Verify `package.json` and `bun.lockb` are created and contain correct information.
   - Compare the speed of `npm install` vs `bun install` by adding a few more packages (e.g., `lodash`, `axios`, `jest`). Note timings.

3. **Experiment with scripts**

   - In `npm-demo/package.json`, add a script `"dev": "nodemon index.js"`.
   - In `bun-demo/package.json`, add a script `"dev": "bun run index.js"`.
   - Create a simple `index.js` that logs "Hello, package manager!" to the console.
   - Run `npm run dev` in `npm-demo` and `bun run dev` in `bun-demo`. Confirm both print the message and reload on file changes (using nodemon for npm, and manually restarting for Bun if necessary).

4. **Semantic Versioning practice**

   - In `npm-demo`, install a package with a specific version: `npm install lodash@4.17.20`.
   - Update your `package.json` to use `"lodash": "^4.17.20"`.
   - Run `npm outdated` to see if a newer version is available. If yes, run `npm update` and verify `package.json` and `package-lock.json` update accordingly.
   - Repeat the same steps in `bun-demo` using `bun add lodash@4.17.20` and `bun update`.

5. **Lockfile consistency check**

   - Clone your `npm-demo` repo to another folder (simulate a teammate).
   - Run `npm install`. Ensure `node_modules` is populated exactly as in the original folder (including nested dependencies).
   - Repeat with `bun-demo` in a fresh clone: run `bun install` and compare `node_modules` contents.

---

## Conclusion

You now have a clear understanding of:

- **What packages are** and why package managers exist
- **How to use npm**: initialization, installing, versioning, scripts, lockfile
- **How to use Bun**: initialization, installing, Bun-specific commands, lockfile
- **Key differences** between npm and Bun to help you choose or combine them
- **Best practices** for versioning, lockfiles, dev vs prod dependencies, and scripts

Completing the homework gives hands-on practice. Whether you stick with **npm** for its maturity or experiment with **Bun** for speed, you'll be able to manage dependencies confidently in any JavaScript project. Good luck!
