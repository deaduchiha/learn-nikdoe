---

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Understanding Git & GitHub

**Git** is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in your code. **GitHub** is a platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling seamless collaboration.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Installing Git

Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- Follow default installation settings.
- Verify your installation by typing:

```bash
git --version
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Basic Configuration

Configure your identity in Git:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Check your settings:

```bash
git config --list
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Creating Your First Repository

Initialize your repository:

```bash
mkdir my-first-repo
cd my-first-repo
git init
```

Add a README:

```bash
echo "# My First Project ðŸš€" > README.md
```

Add and commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 5. Connecting to GitHub

Create a repository on GitHub:

- Log in to [github.com](https://github.com).
- Click "New Repository".
- Name your repo and leave the rest at default.

Link your local repo:

```bash
git remote add origin your_github_repo_url
```

Push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 6. Branching & Merging

Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

Switch branches:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Merge branches:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

Delete a branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature-branch
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 7. Handling Conflicts

Conflicts occur when merging branches with overlapping changes.

- Git marks conflicts within files clearly.

Example conflict markers:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is your current branch change
=======
This is the other branch change
>>>>>>>
```

Resolve by editing the file manually and saving it. Then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ 8. Best Practices

- **Commit frequently:** Keep commits small and meaningful.
- **Descriptive commit messages:** Clearly explain what changes and why.
- **Pull regularly:** Always keep your local branch updated.
- **Use `.gitignore`:** Ignore files like `node_modules`, `.env`, etc.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 9. Homework: Practical Exercises

Perform these tasks to strengthen your skills:

1. **Create & Clone:**

   - Create a GitHub repository, clone it locally, add files, commit, and push.

2. **Branching & Merging:**

   - Create two branches, make different changes, and practice merging.

3. **Conflict Simulation:**

   - Simulate a conflict by modifying the same line in two branches, then merge and resolve.

4. **Real-World Scenario:**

   - Imagine you're collaborating with a friend. Simulate two people pushing conflicting changes, resolve these conflicts, and document the process clearly.

---

ðŸŽ¯ **Checkpoint:**
After completing this guide, you'll confidently handle essential Git & GitHub operations, manage collaboration, and resolve conflicts like a pro!
